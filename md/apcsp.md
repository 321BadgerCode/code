Each big idea is covered in more detail in the following sections.

## Creative Development

* Collaboration: Working with others to design, develop, and test software.
* Software development process: The process of creating and delivering software.

## Data

* Binary: The base-2 number system that computers use to represent data.
* Compression: The process of reducing the size of data without losing any information.
* Spreadsheets: Electronic documents that are used to store and manipulate data.
* Data analysis: The process of extracting meaning from data.

## Algorithms and Programming

* Procedural programming: A programming paradigm that uses procedures to solve problems.
* Binary search: An algorithm for finding a specific value in a sorted list.
* Abstraction: The process of hiding the details of a system from the user.
* Time complexity: A measure of how long an algorithm takes to run.

## Computer Systems and Networks

* Hardware: The physical components of a computer system.
* Software: The instructions that tell the hardware what to do.
* The internet: A global network of computers that allows people to communicate and share information.
* Security: The protection of computer systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

## Impact of Computing

* Digital divide: The gap between people who have access to computers and the internet, and those who do not.
* Bias: The tendency to favor one group of people over another.
* Crowdsourcing: The practice of obtaining information or services from a large group of people.
* Copyright: The legal right to control the use of creative works.
* Information security: The protection of information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.
