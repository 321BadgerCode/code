    "## y can't navier stokes be solved?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the motion of fluid flow, are considered to be one of the most important and challenging problems in physics and mathematics. Despite extensive research, it has not been possible to prove that solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations always exist, or to find general solutions for certain types of fluid flow. The difficulty in solving the Navier-Stokes equations stems from their nonlinear and highly complex nature, as well as the presence of turbulent flow, which is difficult to predict and model. Some researchers have proposed simplified models or numerical methods to approximate solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, but a general solution remains elusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## how did they come up with the equation?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Navier-Stokes equations were first derived in the early 19th century by French engineer Claude-Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes, an Irish mathematician. Navier derived the equations independently in 1822 and 1823, while Stokes derived them in 1845.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equations are based on Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force acting on an object is equal to the object's mass multiplied by its acceleration. Navier and Stokes applied this principle to fluid flow by considering the forces acting on a fluid element, such as pressure, viscosity, and external forces. They also took into account the conservation of mass and momentum, which are fundamental principles in fluid dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a set of partial differential equations that describe the motion of a fluid, including how its velocity, pressure, and density change over time and space. These equations are widely used in engineering and physics to study problems such as the flow of liquids and gases through pipes, the behavior of ocean and atmospheric currents, and the dynamics of the Earth's atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "## what is the equation and what r the simplified models?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Navier-Stokes equations are a set of partial differential equations that describe the motion of a fluid. They are typically written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "u: velocity of fluid\n",
    "p: pressure\n",
    "v: viscosity\n",
    "f: external forces\n",
    "\n",
    "∂u/∂t + (u·∇)u = -∇p + v∇²u + f\n",
    "\n",
    "∇·u = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the first equation is the momentum equation, and the second equation is the continuity equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The momentum equation describes how the velocity of the fluid changes over time, taking into account the forces acting on the fluid, such as pressure gradients, viscosity, and external forces. The continuity equation describes how the fluid's density changes over time and space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplified models of the Navier-Stokes equations include the Euler equations, which describe inviscid fluid flow (flow without viscosity), and the Stokes equations, which describe low-Reynolds-number flows (flows with very low velocity or high viscosity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another popular simplified models are the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, which is a statistical model for turbulent flows, used for example in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "These simplified models can be solved more easily than the full Navier-Stokes equations, but they may not accurately capture all the complexities of real-world fluid flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## equations 4 da simplified equ..\n",
    "\n",
    "The Euler equations are a simplified form of the Navier-Stokes equations that describe inviscid fluid flow, or flow without viscosity. They are typically written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "∂u/∂t + (u·∇)u = -∇p + f\n",
    "\n",
    "∇·u = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \"u\" is the velocity of the fluid, \"p\" is the pressure, and \"f\" is any external forces acting on the fluid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first equation, known as the momentum equation, describes how the velocity of the fluid changes over time, taking into account the forces acting on the fluid, such as pressure gradients and external forces. The second equation, known as the continuity equation, describes how the fluid's density changes over time and space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Stokes equations, on the other hand, describe low-Reynolds-number flows, or flows with very low velocity or high viscosity. The Stokes equations are written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "v∇²u - ∇p = f\n",
    "\n",
    "∇·u = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "where \"v\" is the fluid's viscosity. The first equation is known as the Stokes momentum equation and the second equation is the continuity equation, just as in the Navier-Stokes case.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that these simplified models may not accurately capture all the complexities of real-world fluid flow and are only valid under specific conditions."
