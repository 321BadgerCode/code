\section{Binary Search Guessing Algorithm}
\textbf{Input:} $target$, $low$, $high$ \\
\textbf{Output:} Number of guesses

\begin{verbatim}
low = 1
high = 100
guesses = 0

while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) / 2
    guesses = guesses + 1

    if mid == target:
        return guesses
    elif mid < target:
        low = mid + 1
    else:
        high = mid - 1
\end{verbatim}

\section{Exponential Search Guessing Algorithm}
\textbf{Input:} $target$ \\
\textbf{Output:} Number of guesses

\begin{verbatim}
guess = 1
guesses = 1

while guess < target:
    guess = guess * 2
    guesses = guesses + 1

low = guess / 2
high = min(guess, 100)

while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) / 2
    guesses = guesses + 1

    if mid == target:
        return guesses
    elif mid < target:
        low = mid + 1
    else:
        high = mid - 1
\end{verbatim}

\section{Monte Carlo Guessing Algorithm}
\textbf{Input:} $target$, $iterations$ \\
\textbf{Output:} Number of guesses

\begin{verbatim}
guesses = 0

for i = 1 to iterations:
    guess = random number between 1 and 100
    guesses = guesses + 1

    if guess == target:
        return guesses
\end{verbatim}
