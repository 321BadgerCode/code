\section{Introduction}
Algebra 2 serves as a critical bridge between foundational algebraic concepts and more advanced mathematical applications. This paper aims to provide a thorough understanding of Algebra 2 concepts through detailed explanations, a wealth of examples, and comprehensive visuals. We will explore the various facets of algebraic manipulation, graphical representation, and real-world applications, showcasing the significance of these concepts in diverse fields.

\section{Polynomials and Factoring}
Polynomials are fundamental algebraic expressions comprising terms involving variables raised to non-negative integer powers, multiplied by coefficients. Factoring, on the other hand, involves decomposing polynomials into simpler expressions that help unveil crucial information about their behavior.

\subsection{Polynomial Operations}
Consider the polynomial $P(x) = 3x^3 - 7x^2 + 5x - 2$. We can perform various operations on polynomials, including addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Let's simplify $P(x) + 2x^2$:
\begin{align*}
    P(x) + 2x^2 &= 3x^3 - 7x^2 + 5x - 2 + 2x^2 \\
    &= 3x^3 - 5x^2 + 5x - 2
\end{align*}

\subsection{Factoring Techniques}
Factoring is a crucial skill in Algebra 2, enabling us to express complex polynomials as products of simpler terms. Consider the quadratic polynomial $Q(x) = x^2 - 6x + 9$. Factoring by using the perfect square trinomial pattern:
\begin{align*}
    Q(x) &= x^2 - 6x + 9 \\
    &= (x - 3)^2
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Example: Factoring Perfect Square Trinomials}
Let's factor the perfect square trinomial $R(x) = x^2 - 10x + 25$.
\begin{align*}
    R(x) &= x^2 - 10x + 25 \\
    &= (x - 5)^2
\end{align*}
\boxedanswer{Answer: $R(x) = (x - 5)^2$}

\subsubsection{Example: Factoring by Grouping}
Consider the polynomial $S(x) = 3x^3 - 5x^2 + 6x - 10$. We can factor it by grouping:
\begin{align*}
    S(x) &= 3x^3 - 5x^2 + 6x - 10 \\
    &= (3x^3 - 5x^2) + (6x - 10) \\
    &= x^2(3x - 5) + 2(3x - 5) \\
    &= (x^2 + 2)(3x - 5)
\end{align*}
\boxedanswer{Answer: $S(x) = (x^2 + 2)(3x - 5)$}

\section{Rational Expressions}
Rational expressions are ratios of polynomials. They play a significant role in various mathematical applications, including solving equations involving fractions.

\subsection{Simplifying Rational Expressions}
Simplifying rational expressions involves canceling common factors between the numerator and the denominator. Consider the rational expression $R(x) = \frac{2x^2 + 6x}{4x^2 - 2x}$. We can simplify it by factoring out common terms:
\begin{align*}
    R(x) &= \frac{2x(x + 3)}{2x(2x - 1)} \\
    &= \frac{x + 3}{2x - 1}
\end{align*}
\boxedanswer{Answer: $R(x) = \frac{x + 3}{2x - 1}$}

\subsection{Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions}
Rational expressions can be added and subtracted by finding a common denominator and performing the operation on the numerators. Consider the rational expressions $A(x) = \frac{2x}{x + 1}$ and $B(x) = \frac{x}{x + 1}$. Let's add them:
\begin{align*}
    A(x) + B(x) &= \frac{2x}{x + 1} + \frac{x}{x + 1} \\
    &= \frac{3x}{x + 1}
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Example: Subtracting Rational Expressions}
Subtract the rational expressions $C(x) = \frac{x}{x - 2}$ and $D(x) = \frac{2}{x - 2}$:
\begin{align*}
    C(x) - D(x) &= \frac{x}{x - 2} - \frac{2}{x - 2} \\
    &= \frac{x - 2}{x - 2} \\
    &= 1
\end{align*}
\boxedanswer{Answer: $C(x) - D(x) = 1$}

\section{Quadratic Functions and Equations}
Quadratic functions form the basis for understanding parabolic curves and solving various real-world problems. Equations involving quadratic functions are essential in engineering, physics, and other disciplines.

\subsection{Vertex Form and Completing the Square}
The vertex form of a quadratic function is given by $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ represents the vertex. Completing the square is a technique used to convert a quadratic expression into vertex form.

\subsubsection{Example: Finding the Vertex}
Consider the quadratic function $f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 8$. To find the vertex, complete the square:
\begin{align*}
    f(x) &= x^2 - 6x + 8 \\
    &= (x - 3)^2 - 1
\end{align*}
The vertex is $(3, -1)$.

\subsubsection{Example: Solving Quadratic Equations}
Solve the quadratic equation $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$ using factoring:
\begin{align*}
    (x - 2)(x - 3) &= 0 \\
    x - 2 &= 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 3 = 0 \\
    x &= 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 3
\end{align*}
The solutions are $x = 2$ and $x = 3$.

\subsection{Quadratic Formula}
The quadratic formula provides a method for solving quadratic equations of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. The solutions are given by:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

\subsubsection{Example: Using the Quadratic Formula}
Solve the quadratic equation $2x^2 - 5x + 3 = 0$ using the quadratic formula:
\begin{align*}
    a &= 2, \quad b = -5, \quad c = 3 \\
    x &= \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 3}}{2 \cdot 2} \\
    x &= \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 24}}{4} \\
    x &= \frac{5 \pm 1}{4} \\
    x &= 1 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{3}{2}
\end{align*}
The solutions are $x = 1$ and $x = \frac{3}{2}$.

\section{Exponential and Logarithmic Functions}
Exponential and logarithmic functions play a significant role in modeling growth, decay, and various real-world phenomena. They are essential in fields such as finance, biology, and physics.

\subsection{Exponential Growth and Decay}
Exponential functions describe processes of growth or decay that occur at a constant relative rate. The general form of an exponential function is $f(x) = ab^x$, where $a$ is the initial amount and $b$ is the base of the exponent.

\subsubsection{Example: Exponential Growth}
Suppose a population doubles every 3 years. If the initial population is 1000, find the population after 9 years.
\begin{align*}
    a &= 1000, \quad b = 2, \quad x = 9 \\
    f(9) &= 1000 \cdot 2^{\frac{9}{3}} \\
    &= 1000 \cdot 2^3 \\
    &= 8000
\end{align*}
The population after 9 years is 8000.

\subsubsection{Example: Exponential Decay}
A radioactive substance decays at a rate of 10% per year. If the initial amount is 500 grams, find the amount after 5 years.
\begin{align*}
    a &= 500, \quad b = 0.9, \quad x = 5 \\
    f(5) &= 500 \cdot 0.9^5 \\
    &\approx 295.24
\end{align*}
The amount after 5 years is approximately 295.24 grams.

\subsection{Solving Logarithmic Equations}
Logarithmic equations involve finding the values of variables in logarithmic expressions. Logarithmic functions are the inverse of exponential functions.

\subsubsection{Example: Solving Logarithmic Equations}
Solve the logarithmic equation $\log_2(x + 4) = 3$:
\begin{align*}
    x + 4 &= 2^3 \\
    x &= 8 - 4 \\
    x &= 4
\end{align*}
The solution is $x = 4$.

\section{Conic Sections}
Conic sections are geometric shapes that result from the intersection of a plane with a cone. They include the circle, ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola.

\subsection{Equation of a Circle}
The equation of a circle with center $(h, k)$ and radius $r$ is given by:
\[ (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \]

\subsubsection{Example: Equation of a Circle}
Find the equation of a circle with center at $(2, -3)$ and radius 5.
\begin{align*}
    (x - 2)^2 + (y + 3)^2 &= 5^2 \\
    (x - 2)^2 + (y + 3)^2 &= 25
\end{align*}
The equation is $(x - 2)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 25$.

\subsection{Graphing an Ellipse}
An ellipse is a set of points such that the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to its two foci is constant.

\subsubsection{Example: Graphing an Ellipse}
Graph the ellipse with major axis along the $x$-axis, center at the origin, and semi-major axis length 4, and semi-minor axis length 3.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \draw[thick] (0, 0) ellipse (4 and 3);
        \draw[fill] (0, 0) circle [radius=0.05];
        \node[above] at (0, 3) {$a$};
        \node[right] at (4, 0) {$b$};
        \node[below right] at (0, 0) {$(0, 0)$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\section{Systems of Equations and Inequalities}
Systems of equations involve multiple equations with the same variables. Solving systems helps us find common solutions that satisfy all the equations simultaneously.

\subsection{Solving a Linear System}
Linear systems consist of linear equations. The solution to a linear system is the point where the lines representing the equations intersect.

\subsubsection{Example: Solving a Linear System}
Solve the linear system:
\begin{align*}
    2x + 3y &= 10 \\
    3x - y &= 4
\end{align*}
We can solve this system using the elimination method:
\begin{align*}
    2x + 3y &= 10 \\
    6x - 2y &= 12
\end{align*}
Subtracting the equations yields $4x + 5y = -2$. Solving for $y$, $y = -\frac{4x + 2}{5}$. Substituting into the second equation, $3x - \left(-\frac{4x + 2}{5}\right) = 4$. Solving for $x$, $x = \frac{26}{9}$. Substituting into $2x + 3y = 10$, $y = \frac{16}{9}$. So, the solution is $x = \frac{26}{9}$, $y = \frac{16}{9}$.

\subsection{Graphical Interpretation}
Graphically, solving a system of equations corresponds to finding the point of intersection between the lines representing the equations.

\subsubsection{Example: Graphical Solution}
Graph the linear equations:
\begin{align*}
    y &= 2x + 1 \\
    y &= -\frac{1}{3}x + 2
\end{align*}
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{axis}[
            xlabel=$x$,
            ylabel=$y$,
            xmin=-2, xmax=3,
            ymin=-2, ymax=5,
            grid=both,
            xtick={-2, -1, ..., 3},
            ytick={-2, -1, ..., 5},
            legend pos=north west,
        ]
        \addplot[blue, domain=-2:3]{2*x + 1};
        \addplot[red, domain=-2:3]{-1/3*x + 2};
        \legend{$y = 2x + 1$, $y = -\frac{1}{3}x + 2$}
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
The point of intersection is approximately $(1, 3)$.

\section{Matrices and Determinants}
Matrices are arrays of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Determinants are scalar values associated with square matrices.

\subsection{Matrix Operations}
Matrix operations include addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Matrix multiplication involves combining rows of the first matrix with columns of the second.

\subsubsection{Example: Matrix Multiplication}
Given matrices $A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 1 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$ and $B = \begin{bmatrix} 5 & 2 \\ 3 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$, let's calculate $AB$:
\begin{align*}
    AB &= \begin{bmatrix} 2 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 3 & 2 \cdot 2 + 3 \cdot 1 \\ 1 \cdot 5 + 4 \cdot 3 & 1 \cdot 2 + 4 \cdot 1 \end{bmatrix} \\
    &= \begin{bmatrix} 19 & 8 \\ 17 & 6 \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

\subsection{Determinants and Inverses}
The determinant of a $2 \times 2$ matrix $\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}$ is $ad - bc$. A square matrix has an inverse if its determinant is nonzero.

\subsubsection{Example: Finding the Inverse}
Given the matrix $C = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 2 \\ 1 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$, find its inverse:
\begin{align*}
    \text{Det}(C) &= 3 \cdot 4 - 2 \cdot 1 \\
    &= 10
\end{align*}
Since the determinant is nonzero, the inverse exists. The inverse of $C$ is given by:
\[ C^{-1} = \frac{1}{\text{Det}(C)} \begin{bmatrix} 4 & -2 \\ -1 & 3 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{10} \begin{bmatrix} 4 & -2 \\ -1 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \]

\section{Probability and Statistics}
Probability deals with the likelihood of events occurring, while statistics involves collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data.

\subsection{Measures of Central Tendency}
Measures of central tendency provide information about the center of a dataset. The mean, median, and mode are common measures.

\subsubsection{Example: Calculating Mean, Median, and Mode}
Consider the dataset: $6, 7, 3, 9, 5, 7, 8$. Calculate the mean, median, and mode.
\begin{align*}
    \text{Mean} &= \frac{6 + 7 + 3 + 9 + 5 + 7 + 8}{7} = \frac{45}{7} \approx 6.43 \\
    \text{Median} &= 6, 7, 3, 9, 5, 7, 8 \\
    \text{Mode} &= 7
\end{align*}

\subsection{Probability Distributions}
Probability distributions describe the likelihood of different outcomes in a random experiment. Discrete distributions include the binomial and Poisson distributions. Continuous distributions include the normal distribution.

\subsubsection{Example: Binomial Distribution}
The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials. Let's say a fair coin is flipped 5 times. What's the probability of getting exactly 3 heads?
\begin{align*}
    P(\text{3 heads}) &= \binom{5}{3} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{5 - 3} \\
    &= 10 \cdot \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{5}{32} \approx 0.156
\end{align*}

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}
Statistical analysis involves methods like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis to make inferences and predictions from data.

\subsubsection{Example: Hypothesis Testing}
A car manufacturer claims that the average fuel efficiency of a new model is 30 miles per gallon (mpg). A sample of 50 cars is tested, and the average fuel efficiency is found to be 29.5 mpg with a standard deviation of 2 mpg. Conduct a hypothesis test at the 5% significance level to determine if the manufacturer's claim is valid.

\begin{align*}
    H_0 &: \mu = 30 \text{ (Claim)} \\
    H_a &: \mu \neq 30 \text{ (Not Claim)}
\end{align*}

Using a two-sample $t$-test formula:
\begin{align*}
    t &= \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} \\
    &= \frac{29.5 - 30}{2/\sqrt{50}} \\
    &= -1.118
\end{align*}

Using a $t$-distribution table for a two-tailed test at $\alpha = 0.05$, the critical values are $\pm 2.011$. Since $-1.118$ is not in the critical region, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There's not enough evidence to conclude that the claim is invalid.

\section{Trigonometry}
Trigonometry studies the relationships between angles and sides in triangles.

\subsection{Trigonometric Ratios}
Trigonometric ratios relate the sides of a right triangle to its angles. The primary ratios are sine, cosine, and tangent.

\subsubsection{Example: Sine, Cosine, and Tangent}
Given a right triangle with an angle of $30^\circ$ and hypotenuse 2, find the values of sine, cosine, and tangent for the angle.

\begin{align*}
    \sin(30^\circ) &= \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{1}{2} \\
    \cos(30^\circ) &= \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
    \tan(30^\circ) &= \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
\end{align*}

\subsection{Trigonometric Identities}
Trigonometric identities are equations involving trigonometric functions that hold true for all values of the variables.

\subsubsection{Example: Pythagorean Identities}
The Pythagorean identities relate the three basic trigonometric functions:
\begin{align*}
    \sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) &= 1 \\
    1 + \tan^2(\theta) &= \sec^2(\theta) \\
    1 + \cot^2(\theta) &= \csc^2(\theta)
\end{align*}

\subsection{Graphing Trigonometric Functions}
Trigonometric functions can be graphed to visualize their behavior.

\subsubsection{Example: Graphing Sine and Cosine}
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{axis}[
            xlabel=$\theta$,
            ylabel=$\text{sine}(\theta), \text{cosine}(\theta)$,
            xmin=-2*pi, xmax=2*pi,
            ymin=-1.5, ymax=1.5,
            xtick={-2*pi, -3*pi/2, ..., 2*pi},
            ytick={-1, 0, 1},
            legend pos=south east,
        ]
        \addplot[blue, domain=-2*pi:2*pi, samples=400]{sin(deg(x))};
        \addplot[red, domain=-2*pi:2*pi, samples=400]{cos(deg(x))};
        \legend{$\text{sine}(\theta)$, $\text{cosine}(\theta)$}
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
