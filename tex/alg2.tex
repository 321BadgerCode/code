\section{Polynomials and Rational Expressions}
Polynomials are central to algebraic manipulation. In Algebra 2 Honors, you explore complex polynomials and their properties. Consider the polynomial \(P(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^2 + 5x + 1\).

\subsection{Polynomial Operations}
Performing operations on polynomials involves addition, subtraction, and multiplication. For instance:
\[ P(x) + Q(x) = (3x^4 - 2x^2 + 5x + 1) + (2x^3 - x^2 + 4) \]

\subsection{Factoring Techniques}
Factoring is essential for simplifying expressions. Employ techniques like:
\[ x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 3)(x + 2) \]

\subsection{Long Division and Synthetic Division}
For polynomial division, long division and synthetic division are used. Let's divide \(Q(x) = 4x^3 + 2x^2 - 7x + 3\) by \(x - 2\).

\subsection{Complex Roots and Fundamental Theorem of Algebra}
In this course, you encounter the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, stating that a polynomial of degree \(n\) has \(n\) complex roots. For example, for \(R(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6\), you can find its roots using synthetic division.

\subsection{Rational Expressions and Equations}
Rational expressions are fractions of polynomials. Rational equations involve solving equations containing rational expressions. Consider the rational equation:
\[ \frac{3x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{2}{x} \]

\section{Complex Numbers}
Complex numbers extend algebra beyond real numbers. The complex number \(z = 3 + 2i\) consists of a real part (3) and an imaginary part (2i).

\subsection{Operations with Complex Numbers}
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers can be performed:
\[ (2 + 3i) \cdot (1 - 2i) = 8 - i \]

\subsection{Polar Form of Complex Numbers}
Complex numbers can also be represented in polar form \(z = r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)\), where \(r\) is the magnitude and \(\theta\) is the argument.

\subsection{De Moivre's Theorem}
De Moivre's Theorem (\(z^n = r^n(\cos n\theta + i \sin n\theta)\)) helps raise complex numbers to powers. For instance, calculate \(z^{128}\) where \(z = 2(\cos \frac{\pi}{3} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{3})\).

\subsection{Roots of Unity}
The roots of unity (\(z^n = 1\)) are fundamental in complex number theory. The solutions lie on the unit circle.

The vertex form \(f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k\) highlights the vertex \((h, k)\). Completing the square aids in transforming quadratic equations.

\subsection{Quadratic Formula and Discriminant}
The quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\) is derived using completing the square. The discriminant \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\) determines the nature of roots.

\subsection{Quadratic Inequalities}

\subsection{Arithmetic and Geometric Series}
The sum of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic series (\(S_n\)) is \(\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)\). The sum of a geometric series (\(S_n\)) is \(\frac{a_1(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}\).

\subsection{Convergence and Divergence}
An infinite series converges if \(S = \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n\) exists. For example, consider the series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}\).

\subsection{Maclaurin Series and Taylor Series}
The Maclaurin series is a special case of the Taylor series (\(f(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + \frac{f''(0)x^2}{2!} + \ldots\)), which approximates functions using polynomials.

\section{Polar Coordinates and Parametric Equations}
Polar coordinates (\(r, \theta\)) provide an alternative representation for points.

\subsection{Polar to Cartesian Conversion}
Converting between polar and Cartesian coordinates requires \(x = r \cos \theta\) and \(y = r \sin \theta\).

Hypothesis testing involves assessing the validity of a statement based on sample data. A significance level (\(\alpha\)) is chosen to make conclusions.

\section{Conic Sections}
Conic sections (\(ax^2 + by^2 + cx + dy + e = 0\)) result from slicing a cone.

\subsection{Equations and Properties of Conics}
Different coefficients yield different conic sections. For instance, consider the equation of a parabola: \(y = ax^2 + bx + c\).

\subsection{Foci and Directrices}
Foci and directrices define the shape of conic sections. For example, an ellipse's foci and directrices contribute to its uniqueness.
